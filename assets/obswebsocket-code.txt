Functions exposed to eval:
  (async) obs - see details at https://github.com/haganbmj/obs-websocket-js
  (async) waitMs(miliseconds: number) - wait in script
  log(message: string) - log message in bot logs

  await obs.send('SetCurrentProgramScene', {
    'sceneName': 'This is another scene'
  });
