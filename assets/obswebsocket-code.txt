/*
To properly wait function to complete, please use await for async functions.

Functions exposed to eval:
  (async) obs - see details at https://github.com/haganbmj/obs-websocket-js
  (async) waitMs(miliseconds: number) - wait in script
  log(message: string) - log message in bot logs

If triggered through event-listener, variable event is accessible
  event - contains all attributes from event like event.username etc.

Example:
  await obs.send('SetCurrentScene', {
    'scene-name': 'My Amazing Scene'
  });
  await waitMs(5000) // wait 5 seconds
  await obs.send('SetCurrentScene', {
    'scene-name': 'This is another scene'
  });
